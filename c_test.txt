The task is to parse a log file and produce a report with the min/max and average response times
for the transactions in the file.   Also generate a list of the number of transactions per second for 0 to 30 seconds.  For example:

---- start
Output:   min/max/average after processing XXX transactions.
   Time      Txns
     0         1
	 1         20
	 2         50
	 
---- end

All of the transactions and replies are logged with a timestamp and a key (the MSN field) will tie them together.   It should be assumed that there are responses without a transaction and transactions without a response. This is not an error.


An input transaction looks like  (note that new lines are added for readability):

------- start
@{010813124706$RQMS 0018437HDRA2|
GDSWB|SGAR7|HRSQ|IAT848537|GMT081947|MSN160A0EC77BAA83|UTTA||
PALSRQ|GDA00212920|GDII|CHNQ|PIDFL307|IND22MAR13|OTD24MAR13|NNT2|RPCOBH|RPIN|
CCN00212920|NCUUSD|ROC2|NPR2|NRM1|MTQE||}@
------- end

With the key being the "RQMS" as the request.

A reply to the above transaction looks like:

------ start
@{010813124706$RPMS 0131903HDRA2|
GDSWB|SGAR7|HRSQ|IAT848537|GMT081947|MSN160A0EC77BAA83|UTTA||

------ end

The key that this is a response is the "RPMS".

Both transactions can be tied together by the MSN field being the same (MSN160A0EC77BAA83)

The timestamp is in position 3 to the $ character and is of the format MMDDYYYYMMSS.  

Due to the one second logging resolution we recognize that there will be some transactions with a zero second response time.  This should not be considered a bug.

Notes:
1:  Speed of processing is important
2:  Code should compile on a Linux or Solaris environment
3:  Justify any non-standard libraries used
4:  A Readme.txt with developer notes, etc would be a plus.
5:  The application should be in a state to be able to be deployed to production.
